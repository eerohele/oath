Oath
====

Oath is a prototype for unit testing XSLT with F#.

See [Examples.fs](https://github.com/eerohele/oath/blob/master/tests/Oath.Tests/Examples.fs) for an example of what it looks like.

I had to abandon it because I don't do XSLT on .NET any more, but if you like the idea, feel free to do whatever you like with the code.
